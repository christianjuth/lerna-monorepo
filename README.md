# Overview ðŸ“š

This repo is a place to apply everything that I love CS. It has a little of everything. This repo includes concepts I learned while studying Computer Science in College (graph search, minimax), concepts I've explored outside of my degree(genetics algorithms, BFS Sudoku solving), and frameworks like Next.js. Most of the code is written in TypeScript, which is my preferred language at the time of writing this. All modules compile to ESM and CJS. This repo also uses the fastest build tools I know of (SWC and Turborepo).
