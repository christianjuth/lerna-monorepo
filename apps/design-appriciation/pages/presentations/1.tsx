                buildings I've ever seen. In my opinion, it seems like someone
                asked themself, "can we build this" and not "should we build

                This design feels sleek, but unlike Blakeney, this feels cold

                could argue that this decor is{" "}
                <Highlight>unobtrusive</Highlight> but in a different way than
                Blakeney. VizLine's decor feels trendy, but in a way that is
                committed to a specific style. For that reason, I don't think
                it's as <Highlight>long-lasting</Highlight>. This one could go

                This is an example of Neumorphic design. Neomorphic design is
                sort of controversial and has not received widespread adoption.
                It draws inspiration from Skewmorphism, which was popular in
                Apple's iOS 1-6 software for the iPhone. While iOS 7, which left
                Skewmophism, was also controversial at the time, many have
                accepted visually simpler design systems like Material Design
                and Apple's "Cupertino Design." Neomorphism is interesting, but
                it reintroduces some of the visual complexity that Apple and
                other companies have moved away from.

                From what I've seen over the past few years, many apps like

                neutral colors, allowing the user's eye to be drawn to colorful
                content instead of the app's interface. Since Neomorphsm does
                not adhere to this content first principle, I believe it is{" "}

                This is a UI library I'm designing. My style draws inspiration

                Say what you will about Apple, but I would argue they are first
                in design when it comes to tech (whether you believe the cost is
                justified or not). One thing that catches my eye is Apple's use
                of the "Squirckle" in both hardware and software. Many brands
                use a square with rounded corners, but the problem with this is
                you can easily see the point at which the rounded corner starts.
                The Squirckle is designed to mask the point at which the edge
                begins to curve (see image below).

                I believe Apple's current design language adheres to Dieter
                Ram's principles of good design. The Squirckle sounds silly, but
                it demonstrates attention to creating a pleasing{" "}
                <Highlight>aesthetic</Highlight>. Something about the rounded
                corners feels friendly, simple,{" "}

                It's crazy to see how far Apple has come. I think their new
                design language is objectively better compared to this old
                design, but you could argue the Apple II design is retro and
                nostalgic. This design feels rougher to me. The way the
                computer's casing cuts into the screen feels{" "}
                <Highlight>obtrusive</Highlight> compared to their newer
                products. The sharp edges (compared to the Squirckle) feel less
                approachable and <Highlight>not aesthetic</Highlight>.
